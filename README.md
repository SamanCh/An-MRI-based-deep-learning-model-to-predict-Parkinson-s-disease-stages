# An MRI-based deep learning model to predict Parkinson’s disease stages - Code

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is amongst the relatively prevalent neurodegenerative disorders with its course of progression classified as prodromal, stage1, 2, 3 and sever conditions. With all the shortcomings in clinical setting, it is often challenging to identify the stage of PD severity and predict its progression course. Therefore, there appear to be an ever-growing need need to use supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence and machine learning methods on clinical and paraclinical datasets to accurately diagnose PD, identify its stage and predict its course. In today’s neuro-medicine practices, MRI-related data are regarded beneficial in detecting various pathologies in the brain. In addition, the field has recently witnessed a growing application of deep learning methods in image processing often with outstanding results. Here, we applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to propose a model helping to distinguish different stages of PD. The results showed that our current MRI-based CNN model may potentially be employed as a suitable method for the distinction of PD stages at a high accuracy rate (0.94).
